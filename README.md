This repository holds the code and data for our NeurIPS 2020 paper.

## Code

We are working on cleaning and updating the code. Stay tuned for an update. If you really cannot wait, you can look at this [anonymized repository](https://github.com/nitarshan/banana-smoothie-recipe-1776).


## Data

The full data set used in our study will be made available here. We will provide 1) a csv file with all experimental records (model configurations, generalization measures, generalization error), 2) we also expect to be able to release the weights of the trained models (although this is a technical challenge due to the size of the data). Stay tuned.
